This project aims to develop a class to compute and graph persistence 
landscapes as proposed by Peter Bubenik and Pawel Dlotko. 

### TODO:
1. Decide on lists vs arrays for the return type of PersistenceLandscapes.
2. Allow the user to specifically pass a list/array of lists/arrays, manually
  specifying the landscape and homological degree.
3. Implement arithmetic operations.
4. Implement norms: $L^2, L^{\infty}$ .
5. Visualization methods.
